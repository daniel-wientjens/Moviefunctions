# Moviefunctions
This package was solely built for the R-Project of Alessandro Girelli, Louis Limnavong and Daniel Wientjens.
Hence they are difficult to use outside of this project.

This package contains the score_key, score_genre, similarities and movies_path functions.
These can be used to calculate the shortest path from one movie to another based on genre and keywords.
The functions score_key and score_genre are used to build a graph of movies.
The functions similarities and movie_path are used to leverage the structure of a graph to get meaningfull information on the imput of movies.
